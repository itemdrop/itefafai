## ✅ ACTIVE: Using Formspree for Automatic Email Sending

The contact form is now configured with Formspree endpoint `https://formspree.io/f/xvgwdrvo` and will automatically send emails to efansav@gmail.com when users submit the form.

## To Set Up Automatic Email Sending:

### Option 1: Formspree (Free - Recommended)
1. Go to https://formspree.io/
2. Sign up with any email
3. Create a new form
4. You'll get a form endpoint like: `https://formspree.io/f/xayzabc123`
5. Replace the handleSubmit function with:

```javascript
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
https://formspree.io/f/xvgwdrvo, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: formData.name,
      email: formData.email,
      company: formData.company,
      subject: formData.subject,
      message: formData.message,
      _replyto: formData.email,
    }),
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    alert('Message sent!');
    // Reset form
  }
};
```

### Option 2: EmailJS (Free)
1. Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
